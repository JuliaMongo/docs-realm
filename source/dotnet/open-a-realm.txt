Open a Synced Realm
-------------------
To open a synced {+realm+}, call the ``GetInstanceAsync()`` method, 
passing in a ``SyncConfiguration`` object that includes the partition name and 
the user. The following code demonstrates this:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Examples.codeblock.open-synced-realm.cs
   :language: csharp

In the above example, the code shows how to open the {+realm+} *asynchronously* 
by calling ``GetInstanceAsync``. You can also open a {+realm+} *synchronously* 
by calling ``GetInstance``, but this may lead to temporary data inconsistencies 
while the remote data is downloaded, and is generally not recommended. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Examples.codeblock.open-synced-realm-sync.cs
   :language: csharp

Open a Local (Non-Synced) Realm
-------------------------------
When opening a local (non-synced) {+realm+}, pass a ``RealmConfiguration`` 
object to either ``GetInstanceAsync`` or ``GetInstance``. The following example 
creates a ``RealmConfiguration`` object with a local file path, sets the 
``IsReadOnly`` property to ``true``, and then opens a local {+realm+}  with that 
configuration information:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Examples.codeblock.local-realm.cs
   :language: csharp

.. note::

   If you specify a local path, that path must already exist on the device.

Close a Realm
-------------
There is no need to manually close a {+realm+} with the .NET SDK. When a {+realm+} 
goes out of scope and is removed from memory, the {+realm+} is closed.
